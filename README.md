# linear-regression-from-scratch-only-using-numpy
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using only NumPy. It demonstrates training a model, making predictions, and calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE). Results are compared with scikit-learnâ€™s Linear Regression to show how the custom implementation performs.
